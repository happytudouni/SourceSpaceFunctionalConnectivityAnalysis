These are a few key matlab programs used in Xie et al. (2019)_BMC Medicine

1. The "BaselineDataProcessing.m" is the program used to preprocess the raw EEG data.
2. The "SourceSpaceFCanalysis.m" is the program used to do source-space FC analysis.
3. Please contact the corresponding author (wanze.xie@pku.edu.cn) for the MATLAB programs used to 
create the Source models for source localization.  
4. The current study used age-appropriate infant/child MRI templates available at NeuroDevelopmental MRI Database.
Please contact John E. Richards (Richards@mailbox.sc.edu) for the templates.
